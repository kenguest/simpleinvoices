<p class=CParagraph>
Simple Invoices focuses on the basic needs on invoicing yet attempts to allow advanced
user more flexibility without compromising simplicity
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Quick and nice looking invoices without having to set up to much stuff.  Just install
the software, enter a biller, a customer and go nuts creating invoices<br>
  <li>PDF export
  <li>Export to Word
  <li>Export to Excel (albeit basic and a total hack byt it works :) )
     <li>Multiple invoice types
     <ul>
       <li>Total inoivces
       <li>Itemised invoices
       <li>Consulting invoices
     </ul>
  <li>Invoice templates - Be able to select(or create) different layouts for your
invoices
  <li>Invoice preferences - Enables you to define and customise all the wordings on the
invoices
  <li>Not limited to just invoices! just choose(or create) a different Invoice
Preference and you can create receipts, extimates, quotes, whaterver type you can think of
  <li>Support for products, tax rates, databse backups, integrated database upgrades
for smooth transition in releaes..
  <li>Payment tracking - track payments of individual invoices and monitor how much
each customer owes you etc..
  <li>Reports
  <li>Translations
     <ul>
       <li>Simple Invoices been translated in numberous languages, the current list is
below, and if its not in your language it very easily to translate it - refer the wiki
        <li>Castellano :: Spanish
        <li>Catala :: Catalan
        <li>Deutsch :: German
        <li>English
        <li>Galego :: Galician
        <li>PortuguÃªs :: Portuguese
        <li>Suomi :: Finnish
     </ul>      
  <li>Free/Open souce software
    <ul>
      <li>the most import is that is free and open source software, meaning that
there will <u>never</u> be charges for the software, it'll always be free in cost and
free/open in development.  What really powers Simple Invoices is not some amazing code its
the license that its released under that enables the openness of development and the
community that are dedicated to creating the best invoicing system possible.
       <li>Most commercial invoicing systems are designed and built in grey corporate
offices begin coded by subjugated developers, run by bosses with their eyes only on the
bottom line.  Simple Invoices and free software turns this non-sense on its head - here an
invoicing system is made by and for people who want the best invoicing system possible,
who are really into invoicing and work because we WANT TO not becuase we have to.  Quality
software can be the only outcome !!!
    </ul>
