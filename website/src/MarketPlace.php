<h4 class=CHeading>Why a Market Place?</h4>
<p class=CParagraph>
Though the Simple Invoices Forums rock and provide the level of support that most people will need, it became clear that some members of the Simple Invoices community required a level of support that was not practical under the normal open source/community model
<br><br>
What also became evident was a need to provide a clear path for development of extensions or modifications and other services for Simple Invoices for specific people on a for $ basis 
<br><br>
