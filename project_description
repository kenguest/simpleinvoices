 
Web-based ERP System (Enterprise Resource Planning).
The system attempts to integrate all data and processes of an organization into a unified system, providing functionality in a single package that would normally be covered by two or more systems.
Modules(*):
1) Sales
CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
Sales and Marketing, Commissions, Service, Customer management, etc.
2) Purchases and
3) Inventory
Supply Chain Management 
Inventory, Order Entry, Purchasing, Product Configurator, Supply Chain Planning, Supplier Scheduling, Inspection of goods, Claim Processing, Commission Calculation, etc.
4) Human Resources 
Human Resources, Payroll, Time & Attendance, Benefits, etc.
5) Accounting
Financials 
General Ledger, Cash Management, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Fixed Assets

Altough there are some other similar projects (WebERP, TinyERP, Compiere, Adempiere, Simple Invoices) our project aims to be much more compact and simple than Compiere/ Adempiere but providing their functionality in a more complete way and specially faster (time response) way than webERP / tinyERP and others.

Unlike the other approaches our software is heavily based on Ajax functionality, feature that we find essential in a web based application because fast time response should be a must in any ERP solution.
Our Ajax controls provide an intuitive, very accessible and agile way to every aspect of the program, reducing the time that takes, for example, to setup a new customer and print a professional invoice or sales order to less than a minute.
 
Right now we are using PHP as the programming language but it is planned a complete rewrite into ruby in the following 3 months.

Basically we are focused on small business necessities and try to provide not only a functional but a state of the art solution for their software necessities.

Thank you,
